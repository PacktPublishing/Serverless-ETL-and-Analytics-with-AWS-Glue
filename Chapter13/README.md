# Chapter 5: Data layouts

Here're the data and sample scripts that we used through this chapter:
* `data.json`
* `compression_by_dataframe.py`
* `partitioning_by_dataframe.py`
* `MeasureCompressionSpeedAndRatio.scala`

## Appendix: Measuring compression speed and ratio with Glue Spark jobs
You can measure compression speed and ratio by running `MeasureCompressionSpeedAndRatio.scala` on AWS Glue. Note that this approximately takes **6-7hours** for a 10-DPUs Glue Spark job.
